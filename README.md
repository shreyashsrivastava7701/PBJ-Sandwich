# PEANUT BUTTER and JELLY SANDWICH

### Peanut butter and jelly sandwich is made up of a couple of slices of white bread, a big blob of peanut butter and two or three spoonfuls of jelly. It maybe not the healthiest thing in the world to eat, but it's really not all that bad. Peanut butter is a good source of monounsaturated fats and minerals.
